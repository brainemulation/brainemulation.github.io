# COS 486 Introduction to Brain Emulation

Introduction to neural network models of brain function based on transcriptomic and connectomic maps of brain structure, with applications to the visual system of the fruit fly Drosophila. Fundamentals of modeling neurons, synapses, and networks. Connectivity motifs, simplified models, and mathematical theory of neural nets. Computation by cellular biophysics. Realistic models ("emulations") based on "-omic" maps. Evaluating the fidelity of an emulation. Parallels with computer vision and robotics.

## Requirements
  - Two 80-minute lectures per week. 
  - Optional office hours with teaching assistants. 
  - Homework assignments involve mathematical theory, data analysis, and computer simulation.

## Prerequisites

  - Expertise in linear algebra, and a programming language like Python. 
  - Exposure to continuous mathematics, and basics of ordinary differential equations. 
  - Prior knowledge of neuroscience is not required, but previous exposure to the structure and physiology of neurons and synapses will be helpful. 
  - Familiarity with artificial neural networks, visual perception, and/or computer vision will also be helpful.

## Assessments

  - Problem sets 20%
  - two in-class exams 40%
  - final exam 40%

## Lectures

Prof. Sebastian Seung will lecture twice a week.
  - MW 9-10:20pm EQuad A224

## Office Hours
TBA\
For students who can’t attend these hours, additional office hours are available by appointment.

## Online discussions
You can ask and answer questions on the Ed site.\
Ed activity counts as class participation and can enhance your grade.

## Homework assignments
Homework assignments will be due on Fridays, and should be submitted on gradescope.

## Homework late policy
There is a accumulated percentage drop on the overall points of 20% per day (eg. 2 days late => -40%). If you have reasons (eg. conference, illness, …) for why you cannot make a deadline, write us (all instructors) an E-mail before the deadline including a suggested new deadline. We will grant requests on an individual basis.
